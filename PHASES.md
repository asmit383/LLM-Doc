# quant-doctor — Project Phases

The missing QA layer between "I quantized a model" and "is it actually still good, and if not, where and how do I fix it."

**Context:** Final-year project. Graded on novelty, technical depth, and demonstrated validation — not revenue. Validation leverages the Arc stack (real V4/QTIP failure cases) plus deliberately-injected bugs.

**Core thesis:** No shipped tool diagnoses *why* a quantized LLM is broken. Quantizers exist (dozens); benchmarkers exist (LLMC); nothing classifies failure modes, attributes damage to layers, or prescribes a fix. The research community just named the failure modes in 2026 (ACL 2026: "From Signal Degradation to Computation Collapse") but left productization as future work.

---

## Validation Strategy (how we prove it works — this is what earns the grade)

1. **Injected-bug detection** — take a healthy model, deliberately break the quantization, show the tool localizes the damage to the correct layer/component.
2. **Both failure modes** — one Signal Degradation case, one Computation Collapse case; show the classifier calls each correctly.
3. **Real case study (Arc/V4)** — retroactively detect the MXFP4-as-INT4 expert bug and the 2-bit tail collapse using activation dumps from the Arc stack.

## Status Legend
`TODO` · `WIP` · `DONE` · `BLOCKED` · `STRETCH`

---

## Phase 0 — Scaffold  `DONE`
Get a runnable package + CLI skeleton on the board before writing real logic.

- [x] `pyproject.toml` with deps (typer, torch, transformers, safetensors, rich, numpy)
- [x] Package structure `src/quant_doctor/`
- [x] `quant-doctor` CLI entry point — `diagnose` command that parses args and prints a plan
- [x] `--help` works end to end
- [x] README with quickstart

**Exit criteria:** `quant-doctor diagnose --help` runs. ✅

---

## Phase 1 — Core Diagnostic (MVP)  `TODO`
The minimum that answers "is it broken, and where?" End-to-end on a small HF model pair.

- [ ] `loader.py` — load ref + quantized via `AutoModelForCausalLM` (auto-detect format)
- [ ] `capture.py` — forward hooks on every decoder layer; run eval tokens; collect paired activations
- [ ] `metrics/statistical.py` — per-layer cosine similarity, MSE, output KL divergence, PPL delta
- [ ] `report.py` — CLI table with the layer-wise heatmap + overall verdict
- [ ] Threshold-based verdict (hardcoded initial thresholds from V4 experience)
- [ ] Works on Llama-3-8B (fp) vs a self-quantized GPTQ/AWQ 4-bit and 2-bit

**Exit criteria:** `quant-doctor diagnose --ref X --target Y` prints a layer heatmap + PASS/BROKEN verdict on a real model pair.

---

## Phase 2 — Failure-Mode Classifier  `TODO`
Go from "it's broken" to "*why*, and what kind of broken."

- [ ] `metrics/interpretability.py` — attention entropy, FFN sign-flip rate, logit-lens divergence, error-subspace rank
- [ ] `metrics/propagation.py` — cross-layer error growth (QEP's Δ_m)
- [ ] `classifier.py` — rule-based decision tree: Signal Degradation vs Computation Collapse vs Format Bug vs Early-EOS
- [ ] Report surfaces the failure signature + repair guidance

**Exit criteria:** classifier correctly labels a Signal Degradation case and a Computation Collapse case.

---

## Phase 3 — Validation & Case Studies  `TODO`
The section that earns the top grade. Prove it works.

- [ ] Bug-injection harness — corrupt a layer / mis-decode a format / force early-EOS
- [ ] Case study A: injected Signal Degradation → tool localizes + classifies
- [ ] Case study B: injected Computation Collapse → tool localizes + classifies
- [ ] Case study C (Arc/V4): `--from-dumps` path; retroactively detect MXFP4-as-INT4 expert bug
- [ ] Write-up: methodology, results, limitations

**Exit criteria:** three reproducible case studies documented with tool output.

---

## Phase 4 — Recipe Generation  `STRETCH`
Close the loop: not just "what's broken" but "here's the fix."

- [ ] `recipe.py` — mixed-precision config from culprit layers + failure mode
- [ ] VRAM-delta estimate
- [ ] Export GPTQ/AWQ/llama.cpp-compatible config
- [ ] `verify` command — re-diagnose after applying recipe

**Exit criteria:** tool emits a mixed-precision recipe that measurably improves a broken quant.

---

## Phase 5 — MoE / Arc Deep Integration  `STRETCH`
The differentiator nobody else has.

- [ ] Per-expert cosine (33k+ experts for V4)
- [ ] Router divergence + expert load skew
- [ ] Arc `--dump-activations` feature (Rust side)

**Exit criteria:** per-expert heatmap that isolates the V4 layer-2 expert blowup.

---

## Design Decisions (locked)

- **Language:** Python (ML ecosystem, pip-installable)
- **CLI:** Typer
- **Loading:** HF `transformers` + `auto-gptq`/`autoawq`/`bitsandbytes` for the zero-grind formats
- **Interpretability:** built from scratch (3–4 primitives), not TransformerLens (too heavy a dep)
- **Custom stacks (QTIP/Arc):** `--from-dumps` activation-file path, not live loading
- **Reference for V4:** the FP4/FP8 pre-ISQ weights (no FP16 exists), compared against post-QTIP
- **Classifier:** rule-based first (clean boundaries from ACL 2026), ML classifier only if time allows

## Non-Goals (explicitly out of scope)
- SaaS / dashboards / web UI
- Fine-tune validation (different problem — divergence is intended, logic inverts)
- Building our own quantizer (we diagnose; existing tools quantize)
- "Any model, any quant" universality — scoped to transformer-family + hookable formats
